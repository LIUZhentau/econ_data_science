We offer three courses to MSc on data analytics. They are listed in order.

* Econ5121: Standard econometrics. 
* Econ5821: Data science. Focus on data processing and programming.
* Econ6820: Machine learning. Focus on modern estimation and inference methods.


The first course is mandatory, which is standard curriculum. The two follow-up 
courses are modern. To equip students with knowledge on contemporary data 
work. 



## Programming language


While the sequel of three courses is in formation, we believe it is best
practice to start with a unified choice of programming language. At present, the
two most popular choices for data science are R and Python. It is sensible
that we start with one of them to build up the sequel, and then see if we
want to include the other. In this regard, it is sensible for our team to
start with R. R is better for people from academic background and trained
in statistics, and this is consistent with most people trained in Mainland
economics programs.

## Infrastructure

SCRP hosted by the department provides a convenient portal for a unifed environment.
It is a remote cluster that does not require local installation. 
An online central structure. 


## Note

We don't call it "big data". This is not what we encounter in a daily manner.
Our Msc students are mostly not good at programming. They don't have experience
with small data, not to mention big data. Such a catchy word does not reflect
the contents.


My own experience with big data came from my work in managing simulated results.
The main job was to manage, complile, and report results from simulations.
It was interesting job and required innovation to conduct in an efficient manager.
These tasks are academic focused and they are of little relevance to tech works.
In this sense, I have no experience of "real world" big data work out of 
the narrow focus of academia.
